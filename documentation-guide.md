# Toshy NixOS Flake Documentation Guide

This guide provides an overview of the documentation created for the Toshy NixOS flake implementation.

## Documentation Overview

We have created several documents to help understand and use the Toshy NixOS flake:

1. **[toshy-nixos-flake-context.md](./toshy-nixos-flake-context.md)** - Comprehensive context for the NixOS flake implementation
2. **[toshy-nixos-flake-summary.md](./toshy-nixos-flake-summary.md)** - High-level summary of the implementation
3. **[toshy-nixos-migration-guide.md](./toshy-nixos-migration-guide.md)** - Guide for migrating from overlay to flake
4. **[nixos-flake-best-practices.md](./nixos-flake-best-practices.md)** - Best practices for creating NixOS flakes

## How to Use These Documents

### For Users

If you are a user who wants to use Toshy with NixOS:

1. Start with **toshy-nixos-flake-summary.md** to get a high-level understanding of the implementation.
2. If you are migrating from the old overlay-based approach, follow **toshy-nixos-migration-guide.md**.
3. For more detailed information, refer to **toshy-nixos-flake-context.md**.

### For Developers

If you are a developer who wants to contribute to Toshy or create your own NixOS flake:

1. Start with **toshy-nixos-flake-context.md** to understand the implementation details.
2. Follow the best practices outlined in **nixos-flake-best-practices.md** for your own projects.
3. Use the examples in **toshy-nixos-flake-context.md** as a reference for your own implementation.

### For System Administrators

If you are a system administrator who needs to deploy Toshy in a NixOS environment:
