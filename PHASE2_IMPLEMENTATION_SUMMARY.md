# Phase 2 Implementation Summary: CLI Accessibility Improvement

## Overview
Phase 2 focused on ensuring that toshy-tray and toshy-gui are properly exposed as CLI commands and can be executed directly from the command line. This improves the user experience and allows for better integration with other applications.

## Key Changes

### 1. Entry Point Definition
- Updated pyproject.toml to ensure all CLI commands are properly defined
- Verified that the entry points map to the correct functions in the codebase
- Added clear documentation for each entry point

### 2. CLI Command Exposure
- Enhanced flake.nix to ensure proper CLI command exposure
- Added a postInstall hook to ensure all CLI commands are executable
- Set toshy-tray as the mainProgram in the package metadata

### 3. NixOS and Home Manager Module Updates
- Modified the NixOS module to ensure proper CLI command exposure
- Updated the Home Manager module to maintain consistency
- Prepared for Phase 3 by removing the toshy-gui service from the NixOS module
- Maintained the toshy-tray service in both modules

### 4. Testing and Verification
- Created a test script to verify CLI command accessibility
- The script checks if each command is available in PATH
- It also verifies command permissions and help output

## Technical Implementation Details

### Entry Point Mapping
The entry points in pyproject.toml map to specific functions in the codebase:

```toml
toshy-tray = "toshy.tray:main"
toshy-gui = "toshy.gui.__main__:main"
toshy-layout-selector = "toshy.layout_selector:main"
toshy-config = "toshy.config:main"
toshy-daemon = "toshy.daemon:main"
toshy-config-generator = "toshy.config_generator:main"
toshy-platform = "toshy.platform_utils:main"
toshy-debug = "toshy.debug_utils:main"
toshy-performance = "toshy.performance_utils:main"
```

### Executable Permissions
The postInstall hook in flake.nix ensures that all CLI commands have the correct executable permissions:

```nix
postInstall = ''
  # Make sure the CLI commands are executable
  for cmd in toshy-tray toshy-gui toshy-layout-selector toshy-config toshy-daemon toshy-config-generator toshy-platform toshy-debug toshy-performance; do
    chmod +x $out/bin/$cmd
  done
'';
```

### Service Configuration
The NixOS module was updated to remove the toshy-gui service, preparing for Phase 3:

```nix
# Service dependencies - only include toshy-tray, not toshy-gui
wants = optionals cfg.gui.tray [ "toshy-tray.service" ];
```

The Home Manager module was updated to maintain consistency:

```nix
# Tray service - keep this service
systemd.user.services.toshy-tray = mkIf cfg.gui.tray {
  # ...
};
```

## Testing
The test_cli_commands.sh script provides a way to verify that all CLI commands are properly exposed and executable. It checks:

1. If the command is available in PATH
2. The command's path and permissions
3. The command's help output

## Conclusion
Phase 2 has successfully improved the CLI accessibility of toshy-tray and toshy-gui. The commands are now properly exposed and can be executed directly from the command line. This lays the groundwork for Phase 3, which will focus on service configuration optimization.

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Phase 3: Service Configuration Optimization
- Ensure only toshy-tray has a systemd service, not toshy-gui
- Update the NixOS and Home Manager modules accordingly
- Ensure toshy-gui can be launched from the tray
