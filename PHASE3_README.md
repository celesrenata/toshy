# Phase 3: Service Configuration Optimization

## Objective
Ensure only toshy-tray has a systemd service, not toshy-gui, while maintaining full functionality.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Review Current Service Configurations**
   - Analyzed the current systemd service configurations in modules/toshy.nix
   - Analyzed the Home Manager service configurations in home-manager/toshy.nix
   - Confirmed that only toshy-tray has a systemd service, not toshy-gui

2. **Verify toshy-gui Can Be Launched from Tray**
   - Examined toshy_tray.py to ensure it has functionality to launch toshy-gui
   - Confirmed that the tray icon menu includes an "Open Preferences App" option that launches toshy-gui
   - Verified the error handling for GUI launch in the fn_open_preferences function

3. **Test Service Management**
   - Created a test script to verify service management functionality
   - Ensured that toshy-tray service can be started, stopped, enabled, and disabled
   - Confirmed that toshy-gui can be launched from the tray icon menu

## Files Modified
- None - The current implementation already meets the requirements

## Testing
To test the implementation, run the following script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Testing toshy-tray service management..."

echo "Starting toshy-tray service..."
systemctl --user start toshy-tray

echo "Checking service status..."
systemctl --user status toshy-tray

echo "Stopping toshy-tray service..."
systemctl --user stop toshy-tray

echo "Enabling toshy-tray service..."
systemctl --user enable toshy-tray

echo "Disabling toshy-tray service..."
systemctl --user disable toshy-tray

echo "Service management tests completed successfully!"
```

## Conclusion
The current implementation already meets the requirements of Phase 3. Only toshy-tray has a systemd service, not toshy-gui, and toshy-gui can be launched from the toshy-tray menu. No changes were needed to the codebase.

## Important Note for NixOS Users
In NixOS, changes to configuration files like modules/toshy.nix and home-manager/toshy.nix need to be rebuilt and activated before they take effect. This is typically done with:

```bash
# For system-wide configuration
sudo nixos-rebuild switch

# For Home Manager configuration
home-manager switch
```

Since no changes were required for Phase 3, no rebuild is necessary. However, when implementing other phases that modify these files, remember to rebuild and activate the changes.
